1. Using the 'Nonlinear deformation of filament' code to calculate the dimensionless nonlinear deformation data pool of actin filaments
 with polymerization lengths from 5nm to 300nm and inclined angles form 1 degree to 90 degree.

The nonlinear deformation data pool includes the information of filament element coordinates, defromation curvature, force and deformation energy (bending, compression and shear energies).

All the data has been put into the files.


2. “ActinPolymerization-based Spatiotemporal Migrations”code:

a. constructing the spatiotemporal multiscale assembling model of the lamellipodial branched actin filament network.

b. the mechanical interaction between the polymerizing actin filaments and the leading-edge membrane, which is confined by ECM resistance, and the nonlinear deformation information
of the polymerizing actin filaments can be extracted from the above data pool based the boundary information of each actin filaments. In this way, the actin-based the cell mgiration in ECM can be
spatiotemporally simulated.
